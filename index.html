            <h3>Hirst painting(Python)</h3>
            <p>Successfully impoted a list of colours from hirsts paintings.
            Using the turtle module was able to draw dots of random coulours across the screen.
            The dots are drawn from left to right with a 10px difference. This creates a similar copy of the hirst paintings

                Using knowledge from OOP, creates a coffee maker class in a python module. The coffee maker class had a report for the number 
                of resources available. It had a method which would receive payment and respond accordingly to alert the user if the funds are sufficient
                or not. There was also a method to check if enought resources are available and then make the coffee.
